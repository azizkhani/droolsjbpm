  <P/>
  The Agenda View shows all elements on the agenda. For each rule on the agenda, the rule name and bound variables are shown.
  <P/>
  An action is added to the right of the view, to customize what is shown:
  <UL>
    <LI>The Show Logical Structure toggles showing the logical structure of the agenda item, or all their details.  Logical structures allow for example visualizing sets of elements in a more obvious way. The logical structure of AgendaItems shows the rule that is represented by the AgendaItem, and the values of all the parameters used in the rule.</LI>
