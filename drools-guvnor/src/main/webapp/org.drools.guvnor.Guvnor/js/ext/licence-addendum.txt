  Ext JS, LLC has licensed the accompanying version of the Ext
  JavaScript library under the terms of version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License (LGPLv3).  LGPLv3 incorporates the terms and
  conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).
  In accordance with section 7 of GPLv3, Ext JS has expressly
  authorized its licensees to remove terms coupled to LGPLv3 license
  notices that are "further restrictions" within the meaning of GPLv3.

  Red Hat has opted to preserve the text of the Ext license notice in
  its entirety to clarify the provenance of the code.  However, to the
  extent that any statements in the Ext LGPLv3 license notice are
  effectively "further restrictions", Red Hat regards those
  restrictions as constructively removed and therefore inapplicable to
  this copy of the Ext library and to all subsequent copies and
  modified versions made from this copy.
