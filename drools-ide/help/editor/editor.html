  <H1>The Drools Editor</H1>
  The most important features of the Drools Editor are:
  <UL>
    <LI>Syntax colouring: The Drools Editor offers some basic syntax colouring.</LI>
    <LI>Syntax checking: Drools files can be checked for consistence, and possible errors or warnings are shown in the Problems View. *.drl files in a Drools Project are automatically checked when building the project. This occurs automatically when the Drools file is saved if the project uses automatic building.</LI>
  </UL>
