  <H1>Drools Plugin</H1>
  This is the Drools Plugin.
  <P/>
  All .drl files in a Drools project are automatically checked for correctness when saved.
  <P/>
  You can create a new Drools Project by selecting File -> New -> Project ... which pops up a 'New Project'-dialog. Select the New Rule Project item in the JBoss Rules folder and click Next. Fill in a name and click Finish. The new Drools Project should have been created.
  <P/>

  <P/>
  The newly created contains an example rule file (Sample.drl) in the src/rules dir and an example java file (DroolsTest.java) that can be used to execute the rules in a Drools engine in the folder src/java, in the com.sample package.  All the others jars that are necessary during execution are also added to the classpath in a custom classpath container called Drools Library [3.0].
  <P/>
  You can create a new Drools DRL File by selecting File -> New -> Other ... which pops up a 'New'-dialog. Select the New Rule Resource item in the JBoss Rules folder and click Next. Fill in a name and select the location where the Drools file should be created and click Finish. A new .java.drl file should have been created. This file already contains some xml that should be extended by adding new rulesets, rules, etc.
  <P/>
  Drools files (ending with .drl) are edited using the <A href="editor/editor.html">Drools Editor</A>. The editor offers some basic syntax colouring, code completion, etc.
  <P/>
  Drools files can be checked for consistence, and possible errors or warnings are shown in the Problems View. *.drl files in a Drools Project are automatically checked when building the project. This occurs automatically when the Drools file is saved if the project uses automatic building.
  <P/>
  When debugging an application using a Drools engine, three new views can be used to check the state of the Drools engine itself: the Working Memory View, the Agenda View and the Global Data View. To be able to use these views, create breakpoints in your code invoking the working memory. For example, the line where you call workingMemory.fireAllRules() is a good candidate.  If the debugger halts at that joinpoint, you should select the working memory variable in the debug variables view.  The following rules can then be used to show the details of the selected working memory:
  <UL>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/workingMemory.html">Working Memory</A> shows all elements in the working memory of the Drools working memory.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/agenda.html">Agenda View</A> shows all elements on the agenda. For each rule on the agenda, the rule name and bound variables are shown.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/applicationData.html">Global Data View</A> shows all global data currently defined in the Drools working memory.</LI>
  </UL>
