Intro
=====

Drools solver isn't backwards compatible at the time.
This file describes how can you upgrade from earlier versions to the latest.

From m2 to next
===============

TODO commit the refactor below

New interface score (replace score as a double) and new class ScoreHolder (replaces ScoreCalculator)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The score isn't a double any more, now it's an implementation of the interface Score.
The *ScoreCalculator classes have been replaced by a ScoreHolder.

If you're using a HardAndSoftConstraintScoreCalculator:

    Old code:
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.calculator.HardAndSoftConstraintScoreCalculator;
        ...
        global HardAndSoftConstraintScoreCalculator scoreCalculator;

    New code:
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.holder.ScoreHolder;
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.DefaultHardAndSoftScore;
        ...
        global ScoreHolder scoreHolder;

Or if you're using a SimpleScoreCalculator:

    Old code:
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.calculator.SimpleScoreCalculator;
        ...
        global SimpleScoreCalculator scoreCalculator;

    New code:
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.holder.ScoreHolder;
        import org.drools.solver.core.score.DefaultSimpleScore;
        ...
        global ScoreHolder scoreHolder;
